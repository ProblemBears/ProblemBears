<p align="center" >
Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Github!
I'm a Software Engineer and self-taught 3D Generalist, interested in game development. I mainly work with C++, Java, and Python, but have also done full-stack web development using the MERN stack. I am a Stony Brook University alumni with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I love animating, tinkering with electronics, playing guitar, and games!
